I used bootstrap for the styling. If it is not installed type:
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3

Run the project by typing:
'npm start'

When searching for an album, click on the search button, enter does not work.

Searching for an album does not work when you have searched an album already, and are on the search result page. It does work on the home page and the detail page. 

I could not get the album image working when seeing the search result.
